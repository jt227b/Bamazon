## Getting Started

 This App takes in orders from customers and depletes stocks from the store's inventory.

### Prerequisites 


```
1. Create a MySQL Database called bamazon.

2. Then create a Table inside of that database called products.

3. The products table should have each of the following columns:

    * item_id (unique id for each product)
    * product_name (Name of product)
    * department_name
    * price (cost to customer)
    * stock_quantity (how much of the product is available in stores)

```
